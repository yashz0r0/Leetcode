There is an 8 x 8 empty chessboard with 1-indexed rows and columns.

You are given an array source = [sr, sc] representing the starting position of a bishop, and an array target = [tr, tc]. In one move, the bishop travels any number of squares along a single diagonal direction, staying within the board.

Return the minimum number of moves for the bishop to land exactly on target. If it can never reach target, return -1.

 
Example 1:


Input: source = [8,1], target = [1,8]

Output: 1

Explanation:

​​​​​​​

A single diagonal move takes the bishop straight from (8, 1) to (1, 8).


Example 2:


Input: source = [4,2], target = [1,3]

Output: 2

Explanation:



The bishop moves from (4, 2) to (3, 1), then from (3, 1) to (1, 3), reaching the target in 2 moves.


Example 3:


Input: source = [1,1], target = [3,4]

Output: -1

Explanation:

No matter how many diagonal moves it makes, the bishop starting at (1, 1) can never land on (3, 4). Thus, the answer is -1.


 
Constraints:​​​​​​​


	source.length == target.length == 2
	1 <= sr, sc, tr, tc <= 8
	source != target
